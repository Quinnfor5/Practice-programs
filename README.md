Hello my name is Quinn Hunter
I have my bachelors degree in Psychology
I am currently in the process of teaching myself Python through online resources and books
My goal is to eventually get myself a job in the IT field
As I am learning Python I want to save, and display my projects, that I work on to see my progress
